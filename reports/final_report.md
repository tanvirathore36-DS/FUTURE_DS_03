# 📊 Task 03 – College Course Feedback Analysis

## 🧠 Project Overview
This project analyzes **student feedback for college courses** to evaluate teaching effectiveness, course structure, and overall student satisfaction.  
The dataset includes **1001 responses** covering various aspects of teaching quality and learning experience.

The analysis uses **Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** to highlight strengths, weaknesses, and improvement areas within the course feedback.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the raw feedback data  
- Explore rating patterns across all course evaluation parameters  
- Identify the highest and lowest rated aspects of teaching  
- Present findings visually using Python libraries  

---

## 🧮 Tools and Libraries
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|----------|
| **Python** | Data cleaning and analysis |
| **Google Colab** | Code execution and visualization |
| **GitHub** | Version control and submission |
| **pandas** | Data manipulation |
| **numpy** | Statistical operations |
| **matplotlib**, **seaborn**, **plotly** | Data visualization |

---

## 🧹 Data Cleaning Summary
- Removed unnecessary column `Unnamed: 0`  
- Verified final dataset: **1001 rows × 9 columns**  
- Checked and filled missing numeric values with median (if any)  
- Ensured column names are consistent and descriptive

## 📈 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The EDA consists of **5 key visualizations**, created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly:

### 1️⃣ Average Rating per Parameter (Bar Chart)
- Displays the mean score for each feedback aspect.  
- **Top-rated aspects:**  
  - Solves doubts willingly  
  - Well versed with the subject  
  - Explains concepts clearly  
- **Lowest-rated aspects:**  
  - Degree of difficulty of assignments  
  - Structuring of the course  

### 2️⃣ Correlation Heatmap
- Shows the relationship between all feedback parameters.  
- Strong correlation found between:  
  - *Explains concepts clearly* and *Use of presentations*  
  - *Solves doubts willingly* and *Provides support beyond classroom*  

### 3️⃣ Rating Distribution (Boxplot)
- Highlights variation and spread in student ratings.  
- Most ratings lie between **4 and 5**, showing overall satisfaction.  

### 4️⃣ Pairplot (Seaborn)
- Displays pairwise relationships between parameters.  
- Confirms that students who rate one teaching aspect highly often rate others similarly.

### 5️⃣ Distribution of Average Student Ratings (Histogram)
- Shows how the overall average rating varies among students.  
- The majority of students gave an average score above **4.0**, reflecting highly positive feedback.

## 💡 Key Insights
1. Students appreciate **teaching clarity** and **instructor expertise**.  
2. The **difficulty of assignments** received comparatively lower ratings.  
3. There’s a strong connection between **clarity of concepts** and **use of presentations**.  
4. Overall feedback suggests **consistent satisfaction** across most parameters.

## 🚀 Conclusion
The analysis provides a data-driven overview of student perceptions about teaching and course design.  
By reducing assignment difficulty and improving course structure, institutions can further enhance student satisfaction.
