# FUTURE_DS_03 - College Event Feedback Analysis 🎓📊

## 🔍 Overview
This project focuses on analyzing **student feedback for college courses** to evaluate teaching effectiveness, course structure, and overall student satisfaction.  
Using Python-based Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), it identifies key strengths and improvement areas in various aspects such as subject expertise, clarity of teaching, and course design.  
All insights are presented through data visualizations created using Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly.
eractive Power BI dashboard.
